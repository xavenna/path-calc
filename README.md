# Arc Position Calculator

Created by xavenna

This program takes two points in 3d space and returns the coordinates of a point that lies
along an arc between the two. This new point is coplanar with the two other points. The
rotation of this plane about the line between the two endpoints is supplied, as well as the
distance between the line and the constructed point.

This was written to facilitate making custom levels in the Super Mario Galaxy series of games
